# Tappy Plane
![Game Image](assets/tappy.png)
## Description
After a couple of months of my programming journey, I decided to give game development a try. I used pygame and made **Tappy Plane**, inspired by a popular mobile game. I have made a small design change in the behavior of the plane controlled by the player to better simulate fluid flying motion instead of bird wings flapping.

## Installation
To download the game, clone this repository using git or download files manually. Then simply run **main.py** using Python.
The game requires pygame and pytweening libraries to run (exact versions are listed in requirements.txt file).

## Usage
Use **Spacebar** to propel your plane upwards. Try to avoid numerous obstacles and collect as many stars as you can to achieve a high score.
